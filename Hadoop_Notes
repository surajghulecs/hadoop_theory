JP1 : NameNode
JP2 : DataNode
JP3 : Secondary NameNode

JP4: JobTracker in Hadoop1 or Resource Manager in Hadoop2
JP5 : TaskTracker in Hadoop1 or Node Manager in Hadoop2


Zookeper: This component of Hadoop will check if the Active NameNode is down. If its down, it will make one of the Passive NameNode as active NameNode. Zookeeper is also multinode. It is also having a cluster and works under. If anyone of the zookeeper will go down, then the next follower will become the leader.

Default heartbeat interval is 3 seconds.

Zonal Node: All metadata will be stored in a zonal node. All the Active-Passive NameNode will fetch the metadata from this Zonal Node.

Types of Node in Hadoop 1:
1. Master Node: Has NameNode and JobTracker
2. Slave Node: Has DataNode and TaskTracker
3. Checkpoint Node: Secondary NameNode.

Type of Node in Hadoop 2:
1. Master Node: NameNode and Resource Manager
2. Slave Node: DataNode and Node Manager
3. Secondary NameNode

Types of Cluster:
1. Single Node: All deamons are running under single node. Also called as Presudo Node. Used for testing.
2. Distributed Cluster: Best practice should have 5 nodes. 1 for Name Node 2 for Secondary NameNode and remaining 3 nodes as Data Node.
